## Alan Turing Question - Turing Test 

* Can machines think ?

Because "thinking" is difficult to define, Turing chooses to replace the question
by another, which is closely related to the question, and is expressed in unambigous words

* Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the *immitation game* ?
